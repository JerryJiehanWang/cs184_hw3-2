    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this assignment, we implement BSDF for different materials to get the effect of different reflect and
        refract properties. We also implement environment lighting and thin lens model to simulate the effect of real
        camera.</p>
    <h2 align="middle">Part 1:  Mirror and Glass</h2>
        <p>In this part, we implement the effect when ray is shooting to a mirror or glass surface. Specifically,
        for mirror surface, this is straight forward, because the outgoing ray is symmetric with respect of the
        normal vector. For refraction, we first need to determine whether a total internal reflection has occured.
        If it does, we only have to implement the reflection part. If not, we follow the Snell's law to calculate
        the correct reflection and refraction rays, given the correct refraction index. And using Schlick's approximation
        when sampling from a pixel to determine whether we sample refraction or reflection.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                m = 0: the only light we can see is the light that surface emits, so in this case we can only see
                the light source.
            </li>
            <li>
                m = 1: The spheres are not rendered, because we need at least 2 bounces to see the effect of reflection.
                Essentially, reflection requires to shoot an additional ray when the camera hits the mirror surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                m = 2: We see the reflection effects on both spheres, but no the refraction effect. That's because it
                requires at least three bounces to see the effect of refraction, due to the fact that refraction need
                one more bounce to escape from the glass sphere. The reflection on glass sphere is very dim, because
                most of the ray are refracted, but not reflected.
            </li>
            <li>
                m = 3: The mirror sphere looks better, because more rays are bounced on the surface. For the glass sphere,
                we start to observe the refraction effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                m = 4: The mirror sphere doesn't change too much, but it's still getting better. And we see a high light
                area under the glass sphere. That's because with one more bounce, the lights are able to get out from
                the sphere and refracted to the floor.
            </li>
            <li>
                m = 5: We see a highlight area on the blue war. That's because with one more bounce, the light on the floor
                are further reflected by the floor (diffusive surface) to the wall.
            </li>
            <li>
                m = 100: With high bounces, the Russian Roulette takes control the number of bounces for each sample.
                Thus, we get a more vivid image in this case.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h2 align="middle">A Few Notes On Webpages</h2>
        <p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. You will probably encounter these problems at some point, so don't wait until right before the deadline to check that everything is working. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
        <li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
        <li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
        Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
        <li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre>
        <li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>
        <li>And again, test your website on the instructional machines early!</li>
